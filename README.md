# Revenue-Prediction

**Problem Statement:**
Mengary is an online E-Commerce company that delivers goods to its customers all over the U.S.A (similar to Amazon). The 3 subsidiary companies under it namely Kariox, Fynota, and Qexty sell products in the Electronics, Food & Beverage, and Clothing Industry segment, respectively. The CEO and the board of directors of the parent company have been excessively worried about the profits for the present year considering their profits were not great last financial year. They wish to predict the profits on each product of the subsidiary companies so that they can adjust the discount given on the loss-making products. But since they donâ€™t know which products are going to produce loss, the management has decided to hire you and your team to help predict the profit for the upcoming financial year. It's almost the end of the financial year 2020-2021 and the data of all the order placement dates and delivery dates(including other features) are known to the company beforehand.

**Objective**
Predict the profits for the remainder of the year 2021 (April to December). The board members have put in a lot of trust in you to accurately predict the profits for the remainder of this year so that they can increase their revenue.
